# CitySim-RPG

I'm a Computer Engineering student but I've always liked political issues. my goal is to implement a game that completely simulates the work of a major. I want to add side quests later, include political tests at the beginning for buffs or debuffs depending on the type of political actions (if you are a socialist, a buff on citizens' happiness, but a debuff on the budget, for example). But first, I'm coding the game engine (how the population grows, etc.)

I'm coding in C for the challenge.
